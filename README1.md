# JSL11: Portfolio Piece: Agile Board - Kanban Task Management App

**LOOM video link:** []

# Introduction

The task was to use the provided user stories to identify and fix bugs in the code, as well as to develop our own functions to extend the application's capabilities. The goal was to enhance the application by crafting code to meet specific functionalities outlined in the user stories, like managing task details and their lifecycle, toggling theme customization, etc.

# Elements Included

Some of the elements in this project were buttons, input fields, modal elements, header elements, and sidebar elements.

# Reflections

# Areas of Mastery

**Task Management:** I believe I was able to maneouvre through creating, editing, deleting, and displaying the tasks according to their boards and status proficiently.

# Challenges Faced

I think this was so far the most demanding project to complete. There were many challenges, one of them being managing the data in localStorage, and ensuring the correct selection and manipulation of DOM elements.

# Overall Learning Experience

Having to fix all the bugs while combining what little UI styling knowledge I have with concepts like DOM manipulation, UI/UX implementation, and event handling almost had me at my breaking point but opened my eyes to daily activities in industry and helped me build on my troubleshooting and overall coding skills.
